# File I/O Exercises

### Exercise 1

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a file name, reads the contents of the file and prints it to the screen.

### Exercise 2

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a file name, then prompts the user to enter the contents of the file, and then saves the content to the file.

### Exercise 3

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a file name, then prints the letter histogram and the word histogram of the contents of the file.

### Exercise 4

Write program that takes a JSON file name as input and plots the X,Y data. Exchange JSON data with others to test your program more thoroughly.

Example Format:
```
{
  "data": [
    [1, 1],
    [2, 2],
    [3, 3],
    [4, 4]
  ]
}
```
### Bonus: Crash Test

Write a program that writes to an in memory file and keeps track of how many characters/bytes were added and prints that information to the screen. Continue adding characters until your program dies.

1. At what count did your computer crash?
2. What kind of error did you get?
3. Did your program crash earlier or later than expected? Why do you think?
