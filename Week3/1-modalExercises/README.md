### Make a Modal Dialog

Using fixed positioning and absolute positioning, you can create a modal dialog that sits in the middle of the page and appears on top of the rest of the page content.

Apply CSS rules to make the modal centered on the page.

### Bonus Challenge

Semi-gray out the rest of the content on the page, and add a drop shadow to the modal dialog. And while we are at it might as well add a little rounded corner to the dialog. You may need to add additional HTML element(s) to the page to achieve this effect.

Hint: research the CSS properties opacity and box-shadow.
