# Exercise 3

Add parameters into the various functions of your shapes module. Include:

1. size - the size of the shape
2. fill - a bool specifying whether to fill or outline the shape
3. color - the color of the shape.
    *Hint: you can use the color function to set both the pen color and the fill color.
4. Make a new .py program that imports the shapes module and uses its functions to draw different shapes of various colors, fills, and sizes.
